<h4>Castle on the Hill</h4>

<p>When I was six years old, I broke my leg </p>
<p>I was running from my brother and his friends</p>
<p>And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down</p>
<p>I was younger then, take me back to when I</p>
<p>Found my heart and broke it here</p>
<p>Made friends and lost them through the years</p>
<p>And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long</p>
<p>I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home</p>
<p>I'm on my way</p>
<p>Driving at 90 down those country lanes</p>
<p>Singing to Tiny Dancer</p>
<p>And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real</p>
<p>When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill</p>
<p>Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes</p>
<p>Running from the law through the backfields and</p>
<p>Getting drunk with my friends</p>
